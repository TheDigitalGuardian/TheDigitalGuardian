**Cybersecurity Analyst | GRC & Risk | Security+ Certified**  
Building systems with soul. Writing policies like they mean something — because they do.

Welcome to my corner of the cyberverse.

I’m a Security+ certified cybersecurity professional with a focus on Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC), risk assessment, and policy development. My background in customer experience, QA, and systems thinking lets me bridge the technical with the human — crafting security solutions that are both actionable and aligned.

I approach security like a ritual — with clarity, intention, and integrity.  
Because cybersecurity isn’t just protection.  
**It’s preservation.**
